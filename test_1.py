The program is trying to determine which payment option is better (more money).
First option is 100 dollars per pay for 10 days. The second pays 1 dollar a day with it being double each day for 10 days. 
There will be two functions to calculate the pay rate
Function1 will calculate for the first option and the function2 will calculate the second option

the function1 will output 100 *= 10 days
function2 will double the amount of that day, each day 

If the amount is equal we output to the user that Option 1 and Option 2 is the same
If option1 is better, we output "Option 1 is better"
if option2 is bette, we output "Option 2 is better"
